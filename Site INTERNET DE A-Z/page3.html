        We can describe User Interface Design as the things users
        see when navigating a digital product and User Experience
        Design as the feeling they have while doing that.
        These two, are definitely different but they must work hand in
        hand for an aesthetic and intuitive interface.
        This is the reason why we can’t compare UI and UX Design
        and we must think of them as a whole process that leads to
        the final product: giving people the experience of using a
        beautiful website, apps or software while being on a journey of
        meeting their goals.
        This picture it showcase the relationship between UX and UI
        design , where is the first one is all about user research ,
        interaction design and information architecture , the second is
        all about colors , layout and typography etc ….
        Relationship between UX and UI design
